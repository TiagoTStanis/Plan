## Key Projects

### 1. E-commerce Platform API (Microservices)

A high-performance RESTful API for an e-commerce system, designed with a microservices architecture to manage products, users, and orders. The system was containerized with Docker and orchestrated with Kubernetes to ensure scalability and resilience.

- **Technologies:** Python, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Redis, Docker, Kubernetes, Stripe API
- **Responsibilities:**
    - Developed the `orders` microservice, processing payments asynchronously with Celery and Redis.
    - Implemented user authentication with JWT and integrated with the Stripe API for payment processing.
    - Created a CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions to automate testing and deployment to the Kubernetes cluster.
    - **Outcome:** Reduced checkout latency by 40% and ensured 99.9% uptime during load tests with Locust.

### 2. Financial Data Analysis System

A platform for ingesting, processing, and visualizing stock market data. The system uses an event-driven architecture with Kafka to process large volumes of data in real-time, providing insights through an interactive dashboard.

- **Technologies:** Python, Pandas, SQLAlchemy, Kafka, PostgreSQL, Docker, AWS S3
- **Responsibilities:**
    - Built Python workers to consume data from a market API (Alpha Vantage) and publish it to Kafka topics.
    - Developed a processing service that consumes the data, calculates technical indicators, and stores them in PostgreSQL and S3.
    - Created a REST API with FastAPI to expose the processed data to a frontend (not included in the project).
    - **Outcome:** The system processes over 1 million market events per day with a latency of less than 200ms.

### 3. Deployment Automation Tool (CLI)

A Python Command-Line Interface (CLI) to automate the deployment of web applications to AWS servers. The tool simplifies infrastructure creation with Terraform and the configuration of CI/CD pipelines.

- **Technologies:** Python, Typer, Terraform, Boto3 (AWS SDK), Docker
- **Responsibilities:**
    - Developed an intuitive CLI with Typer to manage the application lifecycle (create, update, delete).
    - Integrated with Terraform to provision the necessary infrastructure (EC2, RDS, S3) declaratively.
    - Used Boto3 to interact with AWS services, such as uploading build artifacts to S3.
    - **Outcome:** Reduced the setup time for new development environments from hours to under 10 minutes.
